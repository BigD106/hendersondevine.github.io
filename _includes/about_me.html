          I have over 5 years of experience as an Operations Director, and have worked at both small and large organizations. 
          I am proficient in Adobe Creative Cloud, and I create publications like the Eureka Springs Visitor Guide. I love solving problems. 
          I enjoy the satisfaction that comes with completing a project on time, and knocking it out of the park!

           I love making things happen. I am a natural born leader who excels in project management, communication and teamwork. I have had the privelage of
           being involved in many team projects, served on several boards, and work with commissions everyday. I also work for a board of
           directors, which in our organization, is like working on one big team.
